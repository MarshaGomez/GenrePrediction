    \section*{Abstract}
    \paragraph{}
    Websites like PlayStation Now, Steam and Origin, offer lists of games based on genres, this makes it easier for a user to select the game that interests you based on the genre is motivated towards. Tagging of games is a complex process and usually involves a labor-intensive process where the games are assigned to one or more Genres based on the proposals sent by the users and consumers. If we can systematize this process of game tagging, not only will it be fast, save human effort but it will be more accurate than an untrained human as well.

    Public games database such RAWG provides genre information to assist searching. The tagging of games genres is still a manual process which involves the collection of users suggestions and consumers. Games are often registered with inaccurate genres. Automatic genres classification of a game based on its synopsis not only speeds up the classification process by providing a list of suggestion but the result may potentially be more accurate than an untrained human. We will collect data using one of many available apis on internet and compile a data set wich will be primarily based on IGDB (Video Game Data Base). We will rely on text analysis of the Plot/Summary of the movie data collected and train our classifier using text analysis techniques
