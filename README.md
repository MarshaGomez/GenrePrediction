## Abstract

Websites like PlayStation Now, Steam and Origin, offer lists of games based on genres, this makes it easier for a user to select the game that interests you based on the genre is motivated towards. Tagging of games is a complex process and usually involves a labor-intensive process where the games are assigned to one or more Genres based on the proposals sent by the users and consumers. If we can systematize this process of game tagging, not only will it be fast, save human effort but it will be more accurate than an untrained human as well.

## Introduction

Public games database such RAWG provides genre information to assist searching. The tagging of games genres is still a manual process which involves the collection of users suggestions and consumers. Games are often registered with inaccurate genres. Automatic genres classification of a game based on its synopsis not only speeds up the classification process by providing a list of suggestion but the result may potentially be more accurate than an untrained human.

Predicting games genres is a multilabel classification problem where a game can be tagged to more than one genres. For the sake of simplicity, we eill be predict wether a game belong to a particular genre or not
