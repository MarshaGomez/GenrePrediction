# Abstract
Websites like PlayStation Now, Steam and Origin, offer lists of games based on genres, this makes it easier for a user to select the game that interests you based on the genre is motivated towards. Tagging of games is a complex process and usually involves a labor-intensive process where the games are assigned to one or more Genres based on the proposals sent by the users and consumers. If we can systematize this process of game tagging, not only will it be fast, save human effort but it will be more accurate than an untrained human as well.
